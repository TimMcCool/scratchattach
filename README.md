Scratch API wrapper with support for almost all site features. Created by [TimMcCool](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TimMcCool/).

This library can set cloud variables, follow Scratchers, post comments and do so much more! It has special features that make it easy to transmit data through cloud variables.

**Some functions require logging in to Scratch.**
**You also need to have the coding language Python installed on your device.**
*Download Python here if you don't have it: https://www.python.org/downloads/*
